## Technologies
- Benji-Wan-Kenobi is structured as an ASP.NET Core MVC application.
- The project utilizes Microsoft Entity Framework Core and Razor pages as well as Bootstrap.
- The SQL Server and database are hosted via Microsoft Azure and the application itself is also hosted at Azure as a Microsoft Azure Web App.

## Todos
- Would like to implement a search feature
- Potentially expand Character and Planet models to include more data
- Flush out the application with lots of data
